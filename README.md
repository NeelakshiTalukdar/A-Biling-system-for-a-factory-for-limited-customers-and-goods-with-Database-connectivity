# A-Biling-system-for-a-factory-for-limited-customers-and-goods-with-Database-connectivity

This is my first ever python project with tkinter and sqlite3.
I used DB browser as the database as i found it easy and friendly to use.

It's a bit dull but i really put in the whole effort by typing the code without any copy paste learning from different sources.

Additional libraries : Tkinter/tkinter depending in the python version

The login was made with the help of my friend.
